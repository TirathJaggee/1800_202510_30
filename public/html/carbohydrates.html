        <h3>How carbs fit into a healthy diet</h3>
        <p>As part of healthy eating, everyone needs the same type of things, such as vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, protein and fat. These are called nutrients. Together, nutrients in food help the body work.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates are part of a healthy diet. But some carb choices may be better for you than others. Understand more about carbohydrates so you can make healthy choices based on your body's needs.</p>
        <h3>What are carbohydrates?</h3>
        <p>Carbohydrates are sugars in food. Carbohydrates also are the parts of food that the body doesn't digest, called fiber. Carbohydrates are naturally found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains and dairy products.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates also may be added to processed foods. For example, fructose is a type of carbohydrate in fruit, but it can be processed and used to sweeten drinks. Inulin is a fiber found in some fruits and vegetables but also may be added to grain products and protein bars.</p>
        <h2>Types of carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>There are three main types of carbohydrates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple carbohydrates</li>
          <li>Complex carbohydrates</li>
          <li>Fiber</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Simple carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>Simple carbohydrates are sugars that are naturally found in food, such as fructose, glucose, and lactose. These sugars are easily digested and absorbed by the body, making them a quick source of energy.</p>
        <p>Simple carbohydrates are naturally found in fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and honey. However, they also may be added to processed foods, such as candy, soda, and baked goods. These added sugars are often high in calories and low in nutrients, making them less healthy choices.</p>
        <h2>Complex carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>Complex carbohydrates are carbohydrates that are made up of long chains of sugar molecules. These carbohydrates take longer to digest and are a better source of energy for the body.</p>
        <p>Complex carbohydrates are naturally found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes. These foods also contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals that are important for overall health.</p>
        <h2>Fiber</h2>
        <p>Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body cannot digest. Fiber helps keep the digestive system healthy and can help lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels.</p>
        <p>Fiber is naturally found in whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. However, it also may be added to processed foods, such as cereals and breads. It is important to include fiber in your diet to support overall health.</p>
