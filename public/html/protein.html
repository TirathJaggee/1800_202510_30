        <h2 class="display-4 fw-bold">Proteins</h2>
        <p>Proteins are micronutrients required by the body to carry out a range of normal functions. However, these micronutrients are not produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat.</p>
        <p>Proteins are organic substances that are generally classified as either fat soluble or water soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K) dissolve in fat and tend to accumulate in the body. Water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins, such as vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate) must dissolve in water before they can be absorbed by the body, and therefore cannot be stored. Any water-soluble vitamins unused by the body is primarily lost through urine.</p>
        <p>Minerals are inorganic elements present in soil and water, which are absorbed by plants or consumed by animals. While you’re likely familiar with calcium, sodium, and potassium, there is a range of other minerals, including trace minerals (e.g. copper, iodine, and zinc) needed in very small amounts.</p>
        <p>In the U.S., the National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) develops nutrient reference values called the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for vitamins and minerals. [1] These are intended as a guide for good nutrition and as a scientific basis for the development of food guidelines in both the U.S. and Canada. The DRIs are specific to age, gender, and life stages, and cover more than 40 nutrient substances. The guidelines are based on available reports of deficiency and toxicity of each nutrient. Learn more about vitamins and minerals and their recommended intakes in the table below.</p>
        <h2>What Is Protein?</h2>
        <p>Protein is found throughout the body—in muscle, bone, skin, hair, and virtually every other body part or tissue. It makes up the enzymes that power many chemical reactions and the hemoglobin that carries oxygen in your blood. At least 10,000 different proteins make you what you are and keep you that way.</p>
        <p>Protein is made from twenty-plus basic building blocks called amino acids. Because we don’t store amino acids, our bodies make them in two different ways: either from scratch, or by modifying others. Nine amino acids—histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine—known as the essential amino acids, must come from food.</p>
        <h2>How Much Protein Do I Need?</h2>
        <p>The National Academy of Medicine recommends that adults get a minimum of 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight per day, or just over 7 grams for every 20 pounds of body weight. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>100 grams of chicken breast: 31 grams of protein</li>
            <li>100 grams of beef: 26 grams of protein</li>
            <li>100 grams of tofu: 19 grams of protein</li>
            <li>100 grams of eggs: 13 grams of protein</li>
            <li>100 grams of fish: 18 grams of protein</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>100 grams of tofu: 19 grams of protein</li>
          <li>100 grams of eggs: 13 grams of protein</li>
          <li>100 grams of fish: 18 grams of protein</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>For a 140-pound person, that means about 50 grams of protein each day.</li>
          <li>For a 180-pound person, that means about 65 grams of protein each day.</li>
          <li>For a 220-pound person, that means about 80 grams of protein each day.</li>
          <li>For a 260-pound person, that means about 95 grams of protein each day.</li>
          <li>For a 300-pound person, that means about 110 grams of protein each day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The National Academy of Medicine also sets a wide range for acceptable protein intake—anywhere from 10% to 35% of calories each day. Beyond that, there’s relatively little solid information on the ideal amount of protein in the diet or the healthiest target for calories contributed by protein. In an analysis conducted at Harvard among more than 130,000 men and women who were followed for up to 32 years, the percentage of calories from total protein intake was not related to overall mortality or to specific causes of death. [2] However, the source of protein was important.</p>
        <p>It’s important to note that millions of people worldwide, especially young children, don’t get enough protein due to food insecurity. The effects of protein deficiency and malnutrition range in severity from growth failure and loss of muscle mass to decreased immunity, weakening of the heart and respiratory system, and death.</p>
        <p>Protein deficiency is also linked to a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. [4] In 2019, a study published in the journal Circulation found that people who consumed too little protein had a 21% higher risk of developing heart disease, stroke, or diabetes compared to those who consumed a healthy amount of protein.</p>
        <p>However, it’s uncommon for healthy adults in the U.S. and most other developed countries to have a deficiency, because there’s an abundance of plant and animal-based foods full of protein. In fact, many in the U.S. are consuming more than enough protein, especially from animal-based foods.</p>
